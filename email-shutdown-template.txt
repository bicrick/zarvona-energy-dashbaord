Subject: How to Manage Your Zarvona Dashboard Billing & Shutdown

Hi [Client Name],

Now that billing is transferred to your account, here's what you need to know:

=== ACCESS INFORMATION ===

Dashboard Login:
- URL: https://zarvona-energy-dashboard.web.app
- Username: user@zarvonaenergy.com
- Password: wtxnorth

Google Cloud/Firebase Console:
- Use your owner account: jlmanzo708@gmail.com
- Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/zarvona-energy-a85ce
- Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=zarvona-energy-a85ce

=== CURRENT STATUS ===

✓ You are now the owner of the Firebase project
✓ Your billing account is paying for all charges (not mine)
✓ I maintain developer access to fix issues and deploy updates
✓ Expected monthly cost: $[X-Y] (varies by usage)

=== MONITORING COSTS ===

View your charges anytime:

Set up budget alerts (recommended):

=== IF YOU WANT TO SHUT IT DOWN ===

I've attached detailed instructions, but here's the quick version:

OPTION 1: Temporarily Disable (Can turn back on)
- Disables the website but keeps data
- Costs drop to near $0/month
- Reversible

OPTION 2: Permanently Delete (Cannot undo)
- Deletes everything: website, data, users
- Billing stops completely
- Backup your data first!

To delete the project:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/zarvona-energy-a85ce/settings/general
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Click "Delete project"
4. Type: zarvona-energy-a85ce
5. Confirm deletion

⚠️  WARNING: This is PERMANENT. All data will be lost.

=== BACKUP BEFORE SHUTDOWN ===

If you plan to shut down:
1. Contact me first - I can export all your data
2. Or follow backup instructions in attached document
3. Save exports to your computer

=== QUESTIONS? ===

- Technical issues or bugs: Email me
- Billing questions: Check Google Cloud Console
- Want to shut down: Let me know first (I can help export data)

See attached SHUTDOWN-INSTRUCTIONS.md for complete details.

Thanks,
